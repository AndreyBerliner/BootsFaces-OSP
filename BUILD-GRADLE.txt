Build instructions with Gradle.
-------------------------------

Building BootsFaces with Gradle is very straightforward, the only prerequisite is having java installed (JDK 7 or later),
there is no need to have Gradle installed.

Just change your directory to the root directory of the project (where you found this file) and execute:

./gradlew

on *NIX systems or

gradlew.bat

on Windows systems.

After few seconds you should see the "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" message and will find the library
in the subdirectory build/libs .
